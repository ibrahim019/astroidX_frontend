This is a lean implementation of the AsteroidX frontend using ReactJS. 
The Shopify stores are added in the home page input text field using complete URLs. 
The indivisual stores display all vendors, prducts per vendor, average price per vendor and a timeline.

We have used React Hooks and not implemented Redux. Also, React Table library has been used for the dashboard.
